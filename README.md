#NHibernate Query Service
##Overview
This repository contains experiments in creating a read only NHibernate OData service. There is a project which explores the latest WCF Data Services implementation and another that looks at the ASP.Net Web API (Fall 2012 Update).

##Setting up the database
There is a SQL 2012 backup of the database in the root folder which requires a login "queryservice".
